# 7.Advanced Views and URLconfs

In Chapter 2, we explained the basics of Django view functions and URLconfs. This chapter goes into more detail about advanced functionality in those two pieces of the framework.

### 

## 1.URLconf Tricks

There’s nothing “special” about URLconfs - like anything else in Django, they’re just Python code. You can take advantage of this in several ways, as described in the sections that follow.

###   (1) Streamlining Function Imports

Consider this URLconf, which builds on the example in Chapter 2:

> ```python
> from django.conf.urls import url
> from . import views
>
> urlpatterns = [
>     url(r'^search-form/$', views.search_form, name='search_form'),
>     url(r'^search/$', views.search),
>     url(r'^contact/$', views.contact),
> ]
> ```

###   (2) Special-Casing URLs in Debug Mode

## 2.Named groups

###   (1)The matching/grouping algorithm

Here’s the algorithm the URLconf parser follows, with respect to named groups vs. non-named groups in a regular expression:

1. If there are any named arguments, it will use those, ignoring non-named arguments. 
2. Otherwise, it will pass all non-named arguments as positional arguments.

In both cases, any extra keyword arguments that have been given will also be passed to the view.

## 3.What the URLconf searches against

The URLconf searches against the requested URL, as a normal Python string. This does not include GET or POST parameters, or the domain name. For example, in a request to http://www.example.com/myapp/, the URLconf will look for myapp/. In a request to http://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3, the URLconf will look for myapp/. The URLconf doesn’t look at the request method. In other words, all request methods - POST, GET, HEAD, etc. - will be routed to the same function for the same URL.

## 4.Captured arguments are always strings

Each captured argument is sent to the view as a plain Python string, regardless of what sort of match the regular expression makes. For example, in this URLconf line:

> ```python
> url(r'^reviews/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive),
> ```

…the year argument to views.year_archive() will be a string, not an integer, even though the [0-9]{4} will only match integer strings.

## 5.Specifying defaults for view arguments

A convenient trick is to specify default parameters for your views’ arguments. Here’s an example URLconf:

In the above example, both URL patterns point to the same view - views.page - but the first pattern doesn’t capture anything from the URL. If the first pattern matches, the page() function will use its default argument for num, "1". If the second pattern matches, page() will use whatever num value was captured by the regex.

## 6.Performance

Each regular expression in a urlpatterns is compiled the first time it’s accessed. This makes the system blazingly fast.

## 7.Error handling

When Django can’t find a regex matching the requested URL, or when an exception is raised, Django will invoke an error-handling view. The views to use for these cases are specified by four variables. The variables are:

> ```python
> • handler404 
> • handler500 
> • handler403 
> • handler400
> ```

Their default values should suffice for most projects, but further customization is possible by assigning values to them. Such values can be set in your root URLconf. Setting these variables in any other URLconf will have no effect. Values must be callables, or strings representing the full Python import path to the view that should be called to handle the error condition at hand.

## 8.Including other URLconfs

At any point, your urlpatterns can “include” other URLconf modules. This essentially “roots” a set of URLs below other ones. For example, here’s an excerpt of the URLconf for the Django Web site itself. It includes a number of other URLconfs:

###   (1)Captured parameters

## 9.Passing extra options to view functions

###   (1)Passing extra options to include()

## 10.Reverse resolution of URLs
