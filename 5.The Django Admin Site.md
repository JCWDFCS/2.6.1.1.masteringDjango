# 5.The Django Admin Site

For most modern Web sites, an admin interface is an essential part of the infras- tructure. This is a Web-based interface, limited to trusted site administrators, that enables the adding, editing and deletion of site content. Some common examples: the interface you use to post to your blog, the backend site managers use to moderate user-generated comments, the tool your clients use to update the press releases on the Web site you built for them.

There’s a problem with admin interfaces, though: it’s boring to build them. Web development is fun when you’re developing public-facing functionality, but building admin interfaces is always the same. You have to authenticate users, display and handle forms, validate input, and so on. It’s boring, and it’s repetitive.

So what’s Django’s approach to these boring, repetitive tasks? It does it all for you.

With Django, building an admin interface is a solved problem. In this chapter we will be exploring Django’s automatic admin interface: checking out how it provides a convenient interface to our models, and some of the other useful things we can do with it.

## 1.Using the Admin Site

> ```python
> $ python manage.py createsuperuser
> ```

## 2.Start the development server 

## 3.Enter the admin site

## 4.Adding Your Models to the Admin Site

## 5.How the Admin Site Works

Behind the scenes, how does the admin site work? It’s pretty straightforward. When Django loads your URLconf from urls.py at server startup, it executes the admin.autodiscover() statement that we added as part of activating the admin. This function iterates over your INSTALLED_APPS setting and looks for a file called admin.py in each installed app. If an admin.py exists in a given app, it executes the code in that file.

In the admin.py in our books app, each call to admin.site.register() simply registers the given model with the admin. The admin site will only display an edit/change interface for models that have been explicitly registered. The app django.contrib.auth includes its own admin.py, which is why Users and Groups showed up automatically in the admin. Other django.contrib apps, such as django.contrib.redirects, also add themselves to the admin, as do many third- party Django applications you might download from the Web.

Beyond that, the Django admin site is just a Django application, with its own models, templates, views and URLpatterns. You add it to your application by hooking it into your URLconf, just as you hook in your own views. You can inspect its templates, views and URLpatterns by poking around in django/- contrib/admin in your copy of the Django codebase - but don’t be tempted to change anything directly in there, as there are plenty of hooks for you to customize the way the admin site works.

If you do decide to poke around the Django admin application, keep in mind it does some rather complicated things in reading metadata about models, so it would probably take a good amount of time to read and understand the code.

## 6.Making Fields Optional

> ```python
> class Author(models.Model): 
>     first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30) 
>     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=40) 
>     email = models.EmailField(blank=True)
> ```

### (1)Making Date and Numeric Fields Optional 

> ```python
> class Book(models.Model): 
>     title = models.CharField(max_length=100) 
>     authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author) 
>     publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher) 
>     publication_date = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
> ```

Adding null=True is more complicated than adding blank=True, because null=True changes the semantics of the database - that is, it changes the CREATE TABLE statement to remove the NOT NULL from the publication_date field. To complete this change, we’ll need to update the database. For a number of reasons, Django does not attempt to automate changes to database schemas, so it’s your own responsibility to execute the python manage.py migrate command whenever you make such a change to a model. Bringing this back to the admin site, now the “Add book” edit form should allow for empty publication date values.

## 7.Customizing Field Labels

> ```python
> class Author(models.Model): 
>     first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30) 
>     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=40) 
>     email = models.EmailField(blank=True, verbose_name='e-mail')
> ```

Make that change and reload the server, and you should see the field’s new label on the author edit form. Note that you shouldn’t capitalize the first letter of a verbose_name unless it should always be capitalized (e.g., "USA state"). Django will automatically capitalize it when it needs to, and it will use the exact verbose_name value in other places that don’t require capitalization.

## 8.Custom ModelAdmin classes

The changes we’ve made so far - blank=True, null=True and verbose_name - are really model-level changes, not admin-level changes. That is, these changes are fundamentally a part of the model and just so happen to be used by the admin site; there’s nothing admin-specific about them.

Beyond these, the Django admin site offers a wealth of options that let you customize how the admin site works for a particular model. Such options live in ModelAdmin classes, which are classes that contain configuration for a specific model in a specific admin site instance.

###   (1)Customizing change lists

> ```python
> from django.contrib import admin
> from .models import Publisher, Author, Book
>
> # Register your models here.
> class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('first_name','last_name','email')
> admin.site.register(Publisher)
> admin.site.register(Author)
> admin.site.register(Book)
> ```

Here’s what we’ve done: 

- We created the class AuthorAdmin. This class, which subclasses django.contrib.admin.holds custom configuration for a specific admin model. We’ve only spec- ified one customization - list_display, which is set to a tuple of field names to display on the change list page. These field names must exist in the model, of course. 
- We altered the admin.site.register() call to add AuthorAdmin after Au- thor. You can read this as: “Register the Author model with the AuthorAdmin options.”

Next, let’s add a simple search bar. Add search_fields to the AuthorAdmin, like so:

> ```python
> class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('first_name','last_name','email')
>     search_fields = ('first_name', 'last_name')
> ```

Reload the page in your browser, and you should see a search bar at the top. (See Figure 5-9.) We’ve just told the admin change list page to include a search bar that searches against the first_name and last_name fields. As a user might expect, this is case-insensitive and searches both fields, so searching for the string "bar" would find both an author with the first name Barney and an author with the last name Hobarson.

Next, let’s add some date filters to our Book model’s change list page:

Here, because we’re dealing with a different set of options, we created a separate ModelAdmin class - BookAdmin. First, we defined a list_display just to make the change list look a bit nicer. Then, we used list_filter, which is set to a tuple of fields to use to create filters along the right side of the change list page. For date fields, Django provides shortcuts to filter the list to “Today,” “Past 7 days,” “This month” and “This year” - shortcuts that Django’s developers have found hit the common cases for filtering by date. Figure 5-10 shows what that looks like.

list_filter also works on fields of other types, not just DateField. (Try it with BooleanField and ForeignKey fields, for example.) The filters show up as long as there are at least 2 values to choose from. Another way to offer date filters is to use the date_hierarchy admin option, like this:

> ```python
> class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('title', 'publisher', 'publication_date')
>     list_filter = ('publication_date',)
>     date_hierarchy = 'publication_date'
> ```

Note that date_hierarchy takes a string, not a tuple, because only one date field can be used to make the hierarchy. Finally, let’s change the default ordering so that books on the change list page are always ordered descending by their publication date. By default, the change list orders objects according to their model’s ordering within class Meta (which we covered in Chapter 4) - but you haven’t specified this ordering value, then the ordering is undefined.

> ```python
> class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('title', 'publisher', 'publication_date')
>     list_filter = ('publication_date',)
>     date_hierarchy = 'publication_date'
>     ordering = ('-publication_date',)
> ```

This admin ordering option works exactly as the ordering in models’ class Meta, except that it only uses the first field name in the list. Just pass a list or tuple of field names, and add a minus sign to a field to use descending sort order. Reload the book change list to see this in action. Note that the “Publication date” header now includes a small arrow that indicates which way the records are sorted. (See Figure 5-12.)

We’ve covered the main change list options here. Using these options, you can make a **very powerful, production-ready data-editing** interface with only a few lines of code.

###  (2)Customizing edit forms

Just as the change list can be customized, edit forms can be customized in many ways. First, let’s customize the way fields are ordered. By default, the order of fields in an edit form corresponds to the order they’re defined in the model. We can change that using the fields option in our ModelAdmin subclass:

> ```python
> class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('title', 'publisher', 'publication_date')
>     list_filter = ('publication_date',)
>     date_hierarchy = 'publication_date'
>     ordering = ('-publication_date',)
>     fields = ('title', 'authors', 'publisher','publication_date')
> ```

After this change, the edit form for books will use the given ordering for fields. It’s slightly more natural to have the authors after the book title. Of course, the field order should depend on your data-entry workflow. Every form is different.

Another useful thing the fields option lets you do is to exclude certain fields from being edited entirely. Just leave out the field(s) you want to exclude. You might use this if your admin users are only trusted to edit a certain segment of your data, or if part of your fields are changed by some outside, automated process.

For example, in our book database, we could hide the publication_date field from being editable:

> ```python
> class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('title', 'publisher', 'publication_date')
>     list_filter = ('publication_date',)
>     date_hierarchy = 'publication_date'
>     ordering = ('-publication_date',)
>     fields = ('title', 'authors', 'publisher')
> ```

As a result, the edit form for books doesn’t offer a way to specify the publication date. This could be useful, say, if you’re an editor who prefers that his authors not push back publication dates. (This is purely a hypothetical example, of course.) When a user uses this incomplete form to add a new book, Django will simply set the publication_date to None - so make sure that field has null=True.

Another commonly used edit-form customization has to do with many-to- many fields. As we’ve seen on the edit form for books, the admin site represents each ManyToManyField as a multiple-select boxes, which is the most logical HTML input widget to use - but multiple-select boxes can be difficult to use. If you want to select multiple items, you have to hold down the control key, or command on a Mac, to do so.

The admin site helpfully inserts a bit of text that explains this, but, still, it gets unwieldy when your field contains hundreds of options. The admin site’s solution is filter_horizontal. Let’s add that to BookAdmin and see what it does.

> ```python
> class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('title', 'publisher', 'publication_date')
>     list_filter = ('publication_date',)
>     date_hierarchy = 'publication_date'
>     ordering = ('-publication_date',)
>     # fields = ('title', 'authors', 'publisher','publication_date')
>     filter_horizontal = ('authors',)
> ```

We’d highly recommend using filter_horizontal for any ManyToManyField that has more than 10 items. It’s far easier to use than a simple multiple-select widget. Also, note you can use filter_horizontal for multiple fields - just spec- ify each name in the tuple. ModelAdmin classes also support a filter_vertical option. This works exactly as filter_horizontal, but the resulting JavaScript interface stacks the two boxes vertically instead of horizontally. It’s a matter of personal taste.

filter_horizontal and filter_vertical only work on ManyToManyField fields, not ForeignKey fields. By default, the admin site uses simple <select> boxes

for ForeignKey fields, but, as for ManyToManyField, sometimes you don’t want to incur the overhead of having to select all the related objects to display in the drop-down.

For example, if our book database grows to include thousands of publishers, the “Add book” form could take a while to load, because it would have to load every publisher for display in the <select> box. The way to fix this is to use an option called raw_id_fields. Set this to a tuple of ForeignKey field names, and those fields will be displayed in the admin with a simple text input box (<input type="text">) instead of a <select>. See Figure 5-14.

> ```python
> class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
>     list_display = ('title', 'publisher', 'publication_date')
>     list_filter = ('publication_date',)
>     date_hierarchy = 'publication_date'
>     ordering = ('-publication_date',)
>     # fields = ('title', 'authors', 'publisher','publication_date')
>     filter_horizontal = ('authors',)
>     raw_id_fields = ('publisher',)
> ```

What do you enter in this input box? The database ID of the publisher. Given that humans don’t normally memorize database IDs, there’s also a magnifying- glass icon that you can click to pull up a pop-up window, from which you can select the publisher to add.

## 9.Users, Groups, and Permissions

Because you’re logged in as a superuser, you have access to create, edit, and delete any object. Naturally, different environments require different permis- sion systems - not everybody can or should be a superuser. Django’s admin site uses a permissions system that you can use to give specific users access only to the portions of the interface that they need. These user accounts are meant to be generic enough to be used outside of the admin interface, but we’ll just treat them as admin user accounts for now.

In Chapter 11, we’ll cover how to manage users site-wide (i.e., not just the admin site) with Django’s authentication system. You can edit users and permissions through the admin interface just like any other object. We saw this earlier in this chapter, when we played around with the User and Group sections of the admin.

User objects have the standard username, password, e-mail and real name fields you might expect, along with a set of fields that define what the user is allowed to do in the admin interface. First, there’s a set of three boolean flags:

- The “active” flag controls whether the user is active at all. If this flag is off and the user tries to log in, he won’t be allowed in, even with a valid password. 
- The “staff” flag controls whether the user is allowed to log in to the admin interface (i.e., whether that user is considered a “staff member” in your organization). Since this same user system can be used to control access to public (i.e., non-admin) sites (see Chapter 11), this flag differentiates between public users and administrators. 
- The “superuser” flag gives the user full access to add, create and delete any item in the admin interface. If a user has this flag set, then all regular permissions (or lack thereof) are ignored for that user.

“Normal” admin users - that is, active, non-superuser staff members - are granted admin access through assigned permissions. Each object editable through the admin interface (e.g., books, authors, publishers) has three permis- sions: a create permission, an edit permission and a delete permission. Assigning permissions to a user grants the user access to do what is described by those permissions. When you create a user, that user has no permissions, and it’s up to you to give the user specific permissions.

For example, you can give a user permission to add and change publishers, but not permission to delete them. Note that these permissions are defined per-model, not per-object - so they let you say “John can make changes to any book,” but they don’t let you say “John can make changes to any book published by Apress.” The latter functionality, per-object permissions, is a bit more complicated and is outside the scope of this book but is covered in the Django documentation.

> Access to edit users and permissions is also controlled by this per- mission system. If you give someone permission to edit users, they will be able to edit their own permissions, which might not be what you want! Giving a user permission to edit users is essentially turning a user into a superuser.
>
> You can also assign users to groups. A group is simply a set of permissions to apply to all members of that group. Groups are useful for granting identical permissions to a subset of users.

## 10.When and Why to Use the Admin Interface - And When Not to

After having worked through this chapter, you should have a good idea of how to use Django’s admin site. But we want to make a point of covering when and why you might want to use it - and when not to use it.

Django’s admin site especially shines when nontechnical users need to be able to enter data; that’s the purpose behind the feature, after all. At the newspaper where Django was first developed, development of a typical online feature - say, a special report on water quality in the municipal supply - would go something like this:

- The reporter responsible for the project meets with one of the developers and describes the available data. 
- The developer designs Django models to fit this data and then opens up the admin site to the reporter. 
- The reporter inspects the admin site to point out any missing or extra- neous fields - better now than later. The developer changes the models iteratively.
- When the models are agreed upon, the reporter begins entering data using the admin site. At the same time, the programmer can focus on developing the publicly accessible views/templates (the fun part!).

In other words, the raison d’Ãªtre of Django’s admin interface is facilitating the simultaneous work of content producers and programmers. However, beyond these obvious data entry tasks, the admin site is useful in a few other cases:

- Inspecting data models: Once you’ve defined a few models, it can be quite useful to call them up in the admin interface and enter some dummy data. In some cases, this might reveal data-modeling mistakes or other problems with your models. 
- Managing acquired data: For applications that rely on data coming from external sources (e.g., users or Web crawlers), the admin site gives you an easy way to inspect or edit this data. You can think of it as a less powerful, but more convenient, version of your database’s command-line utility. 
- Quick and dirty data-management apps: You can use the admin site to build yourself a very lightweight data management app - say, to keep track of expenses. If you’re just building something for your own needs, not for public consumption, the admin site can take you a long way. In this sense, you can think of it as a beefed up, relational version of a spreadsheet.

The admin site is not, however, a be-all and end-all. It’s not intended to be a public interface to data, nor is it intended to allow for sophisticated sorting and searching of your data. As we said early in this chapter, it’s for trusted site administrators. Keeping this sweet spot in mind is the key to effective admin- site usage.

## 11.What’s Next?

So far we’ve created a few models and configured a top-notch interface for editing data. In the next chapter we’ll move on to the real “meat and potatoes” of Web development: form creation and processing.
