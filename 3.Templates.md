# 3.Templates

##   1. Template System Baiscs

A Django template is a string of text that is intended to separate the presenta- tion of a document from its data. A template defines placeholders and various bits of basic logic (template tags) that regulate how the document should be displayed. Usually, templates are used for producing HTML, but Django templates are equally capable of generating any text-based format.

> **Philosophy behind Django templates**
>
> If you have a background in programming, or if you’re used to languages which mix programming code directly into HTML, you’ll want to bear in mind that the Django template system is not simply Python embedded into HTML. This is by design: the template system is meant to express presentation, not program logic.

Let’s start with a simple example template. This Django template describes an HTML page that thanks a person for placing an order with a company. Think of it as a form letter:

> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
>   <head>
>     <meta charset="utf-8">
>     <title>Ordering notice</title>
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     <h1>Ordering notice</h1>
>     <p>Dear {{ person.name }},</p>
>
>     <p>Thanks for placing an order form {{ company }}. It's scheduled to ship on {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y"}}
>     </p>
>
>     <p>Here are the items you've ordered:</p>
>       <ul>
>         {% for item in item_lsit  %}
>           <li>{{ item }}</li>
>
>         {% endfor %}
>       </ul>
>
>     {% if ordered_warranty %}
>       <p>Your warranty information will be included in the packageing.</p>
>     {% else %}
>       <p>You didn't order a warranty, so you're on your own when the products inevitably stop working.</p>
>     {% endif %}
>
>     <p>Sincerely, <br> {{ company }}
>     </p>
>     
>
>
>   </body>
> </html>
> ```

This template is basic HTML with some variables and template tags thrown in. Let’s step through it:

- Any text surrounded by a pair of braces (e.g., {{ person_name }}) is a variable. This means “insert the value of the variable with the given name.” How do we specify the values of the variables? We’ll get to that in a moment. 

- Any text that’s surrounded by curly braces and percent signs (e.g., {% if ordered_warranty %}) is a **template tag.** The definition of a tag is quite broad: a tag just tells the template system to “do something”.

  This example template contains a for tag ({% for item in item_list %}) and an if tag ({% if ordered_warranty %}). A for tag works very much like a for statement in Python, letting you loop over each item in a sequence.

  An if tag, as you may expect, acts as a logical “if” statement. In this particular case, the tag checks whether the value of the ordered_warranty variable evaluates to True. If it does, the template system will display everything between the {% if ordered_warranty %} and {% else %}. If not, the template system will display everything between {% else %} and {% endif %}. Note that the {% else %} is optional. 

- Finally, the second paragraph of this template contains an example of a filter, which is the most convenient way to alter the formatting of a variable. In this example, {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}, we’re passing the ship_date variable to the date filter, giving the date filter the argument "F j, Y". The date filter formats dates in a given format, as specified by that argument. Filters are attached using a pipe character (|), as a reference to Unix pipes.

Each Django template has access to several built-in tags and filters, many of which are discussed in the sections that follow. Appendix E contains the full list of tags and filters, and it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with that list so you know what’s possible. It’s also possible to create your own filters and tags; we’ll cover that in Chapter 8.

## 2. Using the Template System

A Django project can be configured with one or several template engines (or even zero if you don’t use templates). Django ships with a built-in backend for its own template system - the Django Template language (DTL). Django 1.8 also includes support for the popular alternative Jinja2 12 . If you don’t have a pressing reason to choose another backend, you should use the DTL - especially if you’re writing a pluggable application and you intend to distribute templates. Django’s contrib apps that include templates, like django.contrib.admin, use the DTL. All of the examples in this chapter will use the DTL. For more advanced template topics, including configuring third-party template engines see Chapter 8. Before we go about implementing Django templates in your view, lets first dig inside the DTL a little so you can see how it works. Here is the most basic way you can use Django’s template system in Python code:

1. Create a Template object by providing the raw template code as a string. 
2. Call the render() method of the Template object with a given set of variables (the context). This returns a fully rendered template as a string, with all of the variables and template tags evaluated according to the context.

In code, here’s what that looks like:

> ```python
> from django import template
> t = template.Template('My name is {{ name }}.')
> c = template.Context({'name':'Nige'})
> print(t.render(c))
> My name is Nige.
> c = template.Context.Context({'name':'Barry'})
> print(t.render(c))
> ```

###   (1) Creating Template Objects

The easiest way to create a Template object is to instantiate it directly. The Template class lives in the django.template module, and the constructor takes one argument, the raw template code. Let’s dip into the Python interactive interpreter to see how this works in code. From the mysite project directory created by django-admin startproject (as covered in Chapter 1), type python manage.py shell to start the interactive interpreter.

> - [x] **A special Python prompt**
>
>       ****If you’ve used Python before, you may be wondering why we’re run- ning python manage.py shell instead of just python (or python3). Both commands will start the interactive interpreter, but the manage.py shell command has one key difference: before starting the inter- preter, it tells Django which settings file to use. Many parts of Django, including the template system, rely on your settings, and you won’t be able to use them unless the framework knows which settings to use.
>
>       If you’re curious, here’s how it works behind the scenes. Django looks for an environment variable called DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, which should be set to the import path of your settings.py. For example, DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE might be set to 'mysite.settings',
>
>       assuming mysite is on your Python path.
>
>       When you run python manage.py shell, the command takes care of setting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE for you. You will need to use python
>
>       manage.py shell in these examples, or Django will throw an exception.

Let’s go through some template system basics:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template
> >>> t = Template('My name is {{ name }}.')
> >>> print(t)
> <django.template.base.Template object at 0x103f05588>
> ```

That 0x030396B0 will be different every time, and it isn’t relevant; it’s a Python thing (the Python “**identity**” of the Template object, if you must know). **When you create a Template object, the template system compiles the raw template code into an internal, optimized form, ready for rendering.** But if your template code includes any syntax errors, the call to Template() will cause a TemplateSyntax- Error exception:

###   (2) Rendering a Template

 Once you have a Template object, you can pass it data by giving it a context. A context is simply a set of template variable names and their associated values. A template uses this to populate its variables and evaluate its tags. A context is represented in Django by the Context class, which lives in the django.template module. Its constructor takes one optional argument: a dictionary mapping variable names to variable values. Call the Template object’s render() method with the context to “fill” the template:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Context, Template
> >>> t = Template('My name is {{ name }}')
> >>> c = Context({'name' : 'Gaowei'})
> >>> t.render(c)
> 'My name is Gaowei'
> ```

## 3.Dictionaries and Contexts

A Python dictionary is a mapping between known keys and variable values. A Context is similar to a dictionary, but a Context provides additional functionality, as covered in Chapter 8.

Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may contain more letters, digits, underscores, and dots. (Dots are a special case we’ll get to in a moment.) Variable names are case sensitive. Here’s an example of template compilation and rendering, using a template similar to the example in the beginning of this chapter:

- First, we import the classes Template and Context, which both live in the module django.template.
- We save the raw text of our template into the variable raw_template. Note that we use triple quote marks to designate the string, because it wraps over multiple lines; in contrast, strings within single quote marks cannot be wrapped over multiple lines. 
- Next, we create a template object, t, by passing raw_template to the Template class constructor. • We import the datetime module from Python’s standard library, because we’ll need it in the following statement. 
- Then, we create a Context object, c. The Context constructor takes a Python dictionary, which maps variable names to values. Here, for exam- ple, we specify that the person_name is 'John Smith', company is 'Outdoor Equipment', and so forth. 
- Finally, we call the render() method on our template object, passing it the context. This returns the rendered template - i.e., it replaces template variables with the actual values of the variables, and it executes any template tags.

Note that the “You didn’t order a warranty” paragraph was displayed because the ordered_warranty variable evaluated to False. Also note the date, July 2, 2015, which is displayed according to the format string 'F j, Y'. (We’ll explain format strings for the date filter in a little while.)

**If you’re new to Python, you may wonder why this output includes newline characters ('\n') rather than displaying the line breaks. That’s happening be- cause of a subtlety in the Python interactive interpreter: the call to t.render(c) returns a string, and by default the interactive interpreter displays the repre- sentation of the string, rather than the printed value of the string. If you want to see the string with line breaks displayed as true line breaks rather than '\n' characters, use the print function: print (t.render(c)).**

Those are the fundamentals of using the Django template system: just write a template string, create a Template object, create a Context, and call the render() method.

###   (1)Multiple Contexts, Same Template

Once you have a Template object, you can render multiple contexts through it. For example:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template, Context 
> >>> t = Template('Hello, {{ name }}') 
> >>> print (t.render(Context({'name': 'John'}))) 
> Hello, John 
> >>> print (t.render(Context({'name': 'Julie'}))) 
> Hello, Julie 
> >>> print (t.render(Context({'name': 'Pat'}))) 
> Hello, Pat
> ```

Whenever you’re using the same template source to render multiple contexts like this, it’s more efficient to create the Template object once, and then call render() on it multiple times:

> ```python
> # Bad 
> for name in ('John', 'Julie', 'Pat'): 
>     t = Template('Hello, {{ name }}') 
>     print (t.render(Context({'name': name})))
>
> # Good 
> t = Template('Hello, {{ name }}') 
> for name in ('John', 'Julie', 'Pat'): 
>     print (t.render(Context({'name': name})))
> ```

Django’s template parsing is quite fast. Behind the scenes, most of the parsing happens via a call to a single regular expression. This is in stark contrast to XML- based template engines, which incur the overhead of an XML parser and tend to be orders of magnitude slower than Django’s template rendering engine.

###   (2)Context Variable Lookup

In the examples so far, we’ve passed simple values in the contexts - mostly strings, plus a datetime.date example. However, the template system elegantly handles more complex data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and custom objects. The key to traversing complex data structures in Django templates is the dot character (‘.’).

Use a dot to access dictionary keys, attributes, methods, or indices of an object. This is best illustrated with a few examples. For instance, suppose you’re passing a Python dictionary to a template. To access the values of that dictionary by dictionary key, use a dot:

> ```python
> from django.template import Template, Context
> person = {'name':'Sally', 'age':'43'}
> t = Template('{{ person.name }} is {{ person.age }} years old.')
> c = Context({'person':person })
> t.render(c)
> 'Sally is 43 years old.'
> ```

Similarly, dots also allow access of object attributes. For example, a Python datetime.date object has year, month, and day attributes, and you can use a dot to access those attributes in a Django template:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template, Context
> >>> import datetime
> >>> d = datetime.date(1983, 6, 29)
> >>> d.year
> 1983
> >>> d.day
> 29
>
> >>> t = Template('The month is {{ date.month }} and the year is {{ date.year }}.')
> >>> c = Context({ 'date': d })
> >>> t.render(c)
> 'The month is 6 and the year is 1983.'
> ```

This example uses a custom class, demonstrating that variable dots also allow attribute access on arbitrary objects:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template,Context
> >>> class Person(object):
> ...     def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
> ...         self.first_name, self.last_name = first_name, last_name
> ...
> >>> t = Template('Hello, {{ person.first_name }} {{ person.last_name}}')
> >>> c = Context({'person': Person('John', 'Smith')})
>
> >>> t.render(c)
> 'Hello, John Smith'
> ```

Dots can also refer to methods on objects. For example, each Python string has the methods upper() and isdigit(), and you can call those in Django templates using the same dot syntax:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template,Context
> >>> t = Template('{{ var }} -- {{ var.upper }} -- {{ var.isdigit }}')
> >>> t.render(Context({'var': 'hello'}))
> 'hello -- HELLO -- False'
> >>> t.render(Context({'var':'123'}))
> '123 -- 123 -- True'
> ```

?? Note that you do not include parentheses in the method calls. Also, it’s not possible to pass arguments to the methods; you can only call methods that have no required arguments. (We explain this philosophy later in this chapter.) Finally, dots are also used to access list indices, for example:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template,Context
> >>> t = Template('Item 2 is {{ items.2}}')
> >>> c = Context({'items': ['apples', 'bananas', 'carrots']})
> >>> t.render(c)
> 'Item 2 is carrots'
> ```

Negative list indices are not allowed. For example, the template variable {{ items.-1 }} would cause a TemplateSyntaxError.

**Dot** lookups can be summarized like this: when the template system encounters a dot in a variable name, it tries the following lookups, in this order:

- Dictionary lookup (e.g., foo["bar"]) 
- Attribute lookup (e.g., foo.bar) 
- Method call (e.g., foo.bar()) 
- List-index lookup (e.g., foo[2])

The system uses the first lookup type that works. It’s short-circuit logic. Dot lookups can be nested multiple levels deep. For instance, the following example uses {{ person.name.upper }}, which translates into a dictionary lookup (person['name']) and then a method call (upper())

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template, Context
> >>> person = {'name':"Sally", 'age':'43'}
> >>> t = Template('{{ person.name.upper }} is {{ person.age}} years old.')
> >>> c = Context({'person':person})
> >>> t.render(c)
> 'SALLY is 43 years old.'
> ```

###   (3)Method Call Behavior

Method calls are slightly more complex than the other lookup types. Here are some things to keep in mind:

- If, during the method lookup, a method raises an exception, the exception will be propagated, unless the exception has an attribute silent_vari- able_failure whose value is True. If the exception does have a silent_- variable_failure attribute, the variable will render as the value of the engine’s string_if_invalid configuration option (an empty string, by default). For example:

  ```python
  t = Template("My name is {{ person.first_name }}")
  class PersonClass3:
      def first_name(self):
          raise AssertionError('foo')
  p = PersonClass3()
  t.render(Context({'person':p}))
  ```

  Traceback (most recent call last): ... AssertionError: foo

  ```python
  class SilentAssertionError(Exception):
      silent_variable_failure = True
  class PersonClass4:
      def first_name(self):
          raise SilentAssertionError

  p = PersonClass4()
  t.render(Context({"person": p}))
  ```

- A method call will only work if the method has no required arguments. Otherwise, the system will move to the next lookup type (list-index lookup). 

- By design, Django intentionally limits the amount of logic processing available in the template, so it is not possible to pass arguments to method calls accessed from within templates. Data should be calculated in views and then pass to templates for display. 

- Obviously, some methods have side effects, and it would be foolish at best, and possibly even a security hole, to allow the template system to access them.

Say, for instance, you have a BankAccount object that has a delete() method. If a template includes something like {{ account.delete }},where account is a BankAccount object, the object would be deleted when the template is rendered! To prevent this, set the function attribute alters_data on the method:

> ```python
> def delete(self):
> # Delete the account delete.alters_data = True
> ```

The template system won’t execute any method marked in this way. Continuing the above example, if a template includes {{ account.delete }} and the delete() method has the alters_data=True, then the delete() method will not be executed when the template is rendered, the engine will instead replace the variable with string_if_invalid.

**NOTE:** The dynamically-generated delete() and save() methods on Django model objects get alters_data=true set automatically.

### (4)How Invalid Variables Are Handled

Generally, if a variable doesn’t exist, the template system inserts the value of the engine’s string_if_invalid configuration option, which is an empty string by default. For example:

> ```python
> >>> from django.template import Template, Context 
> >>> t = Template('Your name is {{ name }}.') 
> >>> t.render(Context()) 'Your name is .' 
> >>> t.render(Context({'var': 'hello'})) 'Your name is .' 
> >>> t.render(Context({'NAME': 'hello'})) 'Your name is .' 
> >>> t.render(Context({'Name': 'hello'})) 'Your name is .'
> ```

This behaviour is better than raising an exception because it’s intended to be resilient to human error. In this case, all of the lookups failed because variable names have the wrong case or name. In the real world, it’s unacceptable for a Web site to become inaccessible due to a small template syntax error.

## 4. Basic Template Tags and Filters

###    (1)Tags

1. if/else
   - The {% if %} tag evaluates a variable, and if that variable is “True” (i.e., it exists, is not empty, and is not a false Boolean value), the system will display everything between {% if %} and {% endif %}, for example:
   - The if tag may also take one or several {% elif %} clauses as well:
   - The {% if %} tag accepts and, or, or not for testing multiple variables, or to negate a given variable. For example:
   - Use of both and and or clauses within the same tag is allowed, with and having higher precedence than or e.g.:
2. for
   - The {% for %} tag allows you to loop over each item in a sequence. As in Python’s for statement, the syntax is for X in Y, where Y is the sequence to loop over and X is the name of the variable to use for a particular cycle of the loop. Each time through the loop, the template system will render everything between {% for %} and {% endfor %}. For example, you could use the following to display a list of athletes given a variable athlete_list:
   - It’s possible to nest {% for %} tags:
   - If you need to loop over a list of lists, you can unpack the values in each sublist into individual variables. For example, if your context contains a list of (x,y) coordinates called points, you could use the following to output the list of points:
   - This can also be useful if you need to access the items in a dictionary. For example, if your context contained a dictionary data, the following would display the keys and values of the dictionary:
3. ifequal/ifnotequal
4. Comments
   - Just as in HTML or Python, the Django template language allows for comments. To designate a comment, use {# #}:
   - If you want to use multi-line comments, use the {% comment %} template tag, like this:

###    (2)Filters

## 5.Philosophies and Limitations

Now that you’ve gotten a feel for the Django Template Language(DTL), it is probably time to explain the basic design philosophy behind the DTL. First and foremost, the limitations to the DTL are intentional. Django was developed in the high volume, ever-changing environment of an online newsroom. The original creators of Django had a very definite set of philosophies in creating the DTL. These philosophies remain core to Django today. They are:

1. Separate logic from presentation 
2. Discourage redundancy 
3. Be decoupled from HTML 
4. XML is bad 
5. Assume designer competence 
6. Treat whitespace obviously 
7. Don’t invent a programming language 
8. Safety and security 
9. Extensibility

## 6.Using Templates in Views

You’ve learned the basics of using the template system; now let’s use this knowledge to create a view. Recall the current_datetime view in mysite.views, which we started in the previous chapter. Here’s what it looks like:

> ```python
> def current_datetime(request):
>     now = datetime.datetime.now()
>     # Simple way of using templates from filesystem.
>     # This is BAD because it doesn't accout for missing file!
>     fp = open('/Users/Gaowei/Projects/Django/MasteringDjango/the_site/templates/the_site/my_template.html')
>     t = Template(fp.read())
>     fp.close()
>     html = t.render(Context({'current_date': now}))
>     return HttpResponse(html)
> ```

This approach, however, is inelegant for these reasons:

- It doesn’t handle the case of a missing file. If the file mytemplate.html doesn’t exist or isn’t readable, the open() call will raise an IOError excep- tion. 
- It hard-codes your template location. If you were to use this technique for every view function, you’d be duplicating the template locations. Not to mention it involves a lot of typing! 
- It includes a lot of boring boilerplate code. You’ve got better things to do than to write calls to open(), fp.read(), and fp.close() each time you load a template.

To solve these issues, we’ll use template loading and template directories.

## 7.Template Loading

Django provides a convenient and powerful API for loading templates from the filesystem, with the goal of removing redundancy both in your template- loading calls and in your templates themselves. In order to use this template- loading API, first you’ll need to tell the framework where you store your templates. The place to do this is in your settings file - the settings.py file that we mentioned last chapter, when we introduced the ROOT_URLCONF setting. If you’re following along, open your settings.py and find the TEMPLATES setting. It’s a list of configurations, one for each engine:

>  ```python
>  TEMPLATES = [
>     {
>         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
>         'DIRS': [],
>         'APP_DIRS': True,
>         'OPTIONS': {
>             'context_processors': [
>                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',
>                 'django.template.context_processors.request',
>                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
>                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
>             ],
>         },
>     },
>  ]
>  ```

BACKEND is a dotted Python path to a template engine class implementing Django’s template backend API. The built-in backends are django.template.backends.djang and django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2. Since most engines load templates from files, the top-level configuration for each engine contains three common settings:

- DIRS defines a list of directories where the engine should look for template source files, in search order. 
- APP_DIRS tells whether the engine should look for templates inside in- stalled applications. By convention, when APPS_DIRS is set to True, Djan- goTemplates looks for a “templates” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_- APPS. This allows the template engine to find application templates even if DIRS is empty. 
- OPTIONS contains backend-specific settings.

###   Template directories

> ```python
> def current_datetime(request):
>     now = datetime.datetime.now()
>     t = get_template('the_site/current_datetime.html')
>     html = t.render(Context({'current_date': now}))
>     return HttpResponse(html)
> ```

## 8.render()

So far, we’ve shown you how to load a template, fill a Context and return an HttpResponse object with the result of the rendered template. Next step was to optimize it to use get_template() instead of hard-coding templates and template paths. We took you through this process to ensure you understood how Django templates are loaded and rendered to your browser.

In practice, Django provides a much easier way to do this. Django’s developers recognized that because this is such a common idiom, Django needed a shortcut that could do all this in one line of code. This shortcut is a function called render(), which lives in the module django.shortcuts.

Most of the time, you’ll be using render() rather than loading templates and creating Context and HttpResponse objects manually - unless your employer judges your work by total lines of code written, that is. Here’s the ongoing current_datetime example rewritten to use render():

## 9.Template Subdirectories

It can get unwieldy to store all of your templates in a single directory. You might like to store templates in subdirectories of your template directory, and that’s fine. In fact, we recommend doing so; some more advanced Django features (such as the generic views system, which we cover in Chapter 10) expect this template layout as a default convention.

Storing templates in subdirectories of your template directory is easy. In your calls to get_template(), just include the subdirectory name and a slash before the template name, like so:

> ```python
> t = get_template('dateapp/current_datetime.html')
> ```

Because render() is a small wrapper around get_template(), you can do the same thing with the second argument to render(), like this:

> ```python
> return render(request, 'dateapp/current_datetime.html', {'current_date': now})
> ```

There’s no limit to the depth of your subdirectory tree. Feel free to use as many subdirectories as you like.

## 10.The include Template Tag

Now that we’ve covered the template-loading mechanism, we can introduce a built-in template tag that takes advantage of it: {% include %}. This tag allows you to include the contents of another template. The argument to the tag should be the name of the template to include, and the template name can be either a variable or a hard-coded (quoted) string, in either single or double quotes.

Anytime you have the same code in multiple templates, consider using an {% include %} to remove the duplication. These two examples include the contents of the template nav.html. The examples are equivalent and illustrate that either single or double quotes are allowed:

> ```python
> {% include 'nav.html' %} 
> {% include "nav.html" %}
> ```

This example includes the contents of the template includes/nav.html:

> ```python
> {% include 'includes/nav.html' %}
> ```

As in get_template(), the file name of the template is determined by either adding the path to the “templates” directory in the current Django app (if APPS_DIR is True) or by adding the template directory from DIRS to the requested template name. Included templates are evaluated with the context of the template that’s including them. For example, consider these two templates:

> ```django
> # mypage.html
>

- If DEBUG is set to True, you’ll see the TemplateDoesNotExist exception on aDjango error page. 

- If DEBUG is set to False, the tag will fail silently, displaying nothing in the place of the tag.

## 11.Template Inheritance

Our template examples so far have been tiny HTML snippets, but in the real world, you’ll be using Django’s template system to create entire HTML pages. This leads to a common Web development problem: across a Web site, how does one reduce the duplication and redundancy of common page areas, such as sitewide navigation?

A classic way of solving this problem is to use server-side includes, directives you can embed within your HTML pages to “include” one Web page inside another. Indeed, Django supports that approach, with the {% include %} template tag just described.

But the preferred way of solving this problem with Django is to use a more elegant strategy called template inheritance. In essence, template inheritance lets you build a base “skeleton” template that contains all the common parts of your site and defines “blocks” that child templates can override. Let’s see an example of this by creating a more complete template for our current_datetime view, by editing the current_datetime.html file:

**Django’s template inheritance system solves these problems. You can think of it as an “inside-out” version of server-side includes. Instead of defining the snippets that are common, you define the snippets that are different.**

The first step is to define a base template - a skeleton of your page that child templates will later fill in. Here’s a base template for our ongoing example:

> ```django
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
>   <head>
>     <meta charset="utf-8">
>     <title>{% block title %}{% endblock title %}</title>
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     <h1>My helpful timestamp site</h1>
>     {% block content %}{% endblock content %}
>     {% block footer %}
>     <hr>
>     <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
>     {% endblock footer %}
>
>   </body>
> </html>
> ```

This template, which we’ll call base.html, defines a simple HTML skeleton document that we’ll use for all the pages on the site. It’s the job of child templates to override, or add to, or leave alone the contents of the blocks. (If you’re following along, save this file to your template directory as base.html.)

We’re using a template tag here that you haven’t seen before: the {% block %} tag. All the {% block %} tags do is tell the template engine that a child template may override those portions of the template. Now that we have this base template, we can modify our existing current_datetime.html template to use it:

> ```django
> {% extends "the_site/base.html" %}
> {% block title %}The current time{% endblock title %}
>
> {% block content %}
> <p>It is now {{ current_date }}.</p>
> {% endblock content %}
> ```

Isn’t this beautiful? Each template contains only the code that’s unique to that template. No redundancy needed. If you need to make a site-wide design change, just make the change to **base.html**, and all of the other templates will immediately reflect the change.

Here’s how it works. When you load the template current_datetime.html, the template engine sees the {% extends %} tag, noting that this template is a child template. The engine immediately loads the parent template - in this case, base.html.

At that point, the template engine notices the three {% block %} tags in base.html and replaces those blocks with the contents of the child template. So, the title we’ve defined in {% block title %} will be used, as will the {% block content %}.

Note that since the child template doesn’t define the footer block, the template system uses the value from the parent template instead. Content within a **{% block %**} tag in a parent template is always used as a fallback.

Inheritance doesn’t affect the template context. In other words, any template in the inheritance tree will have access to every one of your template variables from the context.

You can use as many levels of inheritance as needed. One common way of using inheritance is the following three-level approach:

1. Create **a base.html** template that holds the main look and feel of your site. This is the stuff that rarely, if ever, changes. 
2. Create **a base_SECTION.html** template for each “section” of your site (e.g., base_photos.html and base_forum.html). These templates extend base.html and include section-specific styles/design. 
3. Create **individual templates** for each type of page, such as a forum page or a photo gallery. These templates extend the appropriate section template.

This approach maximizes code reuse and makes it easy to add items to shared areas, such as section-wide navigation. Here are some guidelines for working with template inheritance:

- If you use {% extends %} in a template, it must be the first template tag in that template. Otherwise, template inheritance won’t work. 
- Generally, the more {% block %} tags in your base templates, the better. Remember, child templates don’t have to define all parent blocks, so you can fill in reasonable defaults in a number of blocks, and then define only the ones you need in the child templates. It’s better to have more hooks than fewer hooks. 
- If you find yourself duplicating code in a number of templates, it probably means you should move that code to a {% block %} in a parent template.
- If you need to get the content of the block from the parent template, use {{ block.super }}, which is a “magic” variable providing the rendered text of the parent template. This is useful if you want to add to the contents of a parent block instead of completely overriding it. 
- You may not define multiple {% block %} tags with the same name in the same template. This limitation exists because a block tag works in “both” directions. That is, a block tag doesn’t just provide a hole to fill, it also defines the content that fills the hole in the parent. If there were two similarly named {% block %} tags in a template, that template’s parent wouldn’t know which one of the blocks’ content to use. 
- The template name you pass to {% extends %} is loaded using the same method that get_template() uses. That is, the template name is appended to your DIRS setting, or the “templates” folder in the current Django app. 
- In most cases, the argument to {% extends %} will be a string, but it can also be a variable, if you don’t know the name of the parent template until runtime. This lets you do some cool, dynamic stuff.

## 12. What's next?

You now have the basics of Django’s template system under your belt. What’s next? Most modern Web sites are database-driven: the content of the Web site is stored in a relational database. This allows a clean separation of data and logic (in the same way views and templates allow the separation of logic and display.) The next chapter covers the tools Django gives you to interact with a database.
