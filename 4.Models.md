# 4.Models

## 1.The “Dumb” Way to Do Database Queries in Views

Just as Chapter 2 detailed a “dumb” way to produce output within a view (by hard-coding the text directly within the view), there’s a “dumb” way to retrieve data from a database in a view. It’s simple: just use any existing Python library to execute an SQL query and do something with the results. In this example view, we use the MySQLdb library to connect to a MySQL database, retrieve some records, and feed them to a template for display as a Web page:

> ```python
> from django.shortcuts import render
> import MySQLdb
>
> def book_list(request):
>     db = MySQLdb.connect(user='me', db='mydb', passwd='secret', host='localhost')
>     cursor = db.cursor()
>     cursor.execute('SELECT name FROM books ORDERED BY name')
>     names = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
>     db.close()
>     return render(request, 'book_list.html', {'name':names})
> ```

This approach works, but some problems should jump out at you immediately:

- We’re hard-coding the database connection parameters. Ideally, these parameters would be stored in the Django configuration. 
- We’re having to write a fair bit of boilerplate code: creating a connection, creating a cursor, executing a statement, and closing the connection. Ideally, all we’d have to do is specify which results we wanted. 
- It ties us to MySQL. If, down the road, we switch from MySQL to Post- greSQL, we’ll most likely have to rewrite a large amount of our code. Ideally, the database server we’re using would be abstracted, so that a database server change could be made in a single place. (This feature is particularly relevant if you’re building an open-source Django application that you want to be used by as many people as possible.)

As you might expect, Django’s database layer solves these problems.

## 2.Configuring the Database

With all of that philosophy in mind, let’s start exploring Django’s database layer. First, lets explore the initial configuration that was added to settings.py when we created the application:

> ```python
> # Database
> # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#databases
>
> DATABASES = {
>     'default': {
>         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
>         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
>     }
> }
> ```

The default setup is pretty simple. Here’s a rundown of each setting.

- ENGINE tells Django which database engine to use. As we are using SQLite in the examples in this book, we will leave it to the default django.db.backends.sqlite3 

- NAME tells Django the name of your database. For example:

  `‘NAME’: ‘mydb’,`

Since we’re using SQLite, startproject created a full filesystem path to the database file for us.

This is it for the default setup - you don’t need to change anything to run the code in this book, I have included this simply to give you an idea of how simple it is to configure databases in Django. For a detailed description on how to set up the various databases supported by Django, see Chapter 21.

## 3.Your First App

Now that you’ve verified the connection is working, it’s time to create a Django app - a bundle of Django code, including models and views, that lives together in a single Python package and represents a full Django application. It’s worth explaining the terminology here, because this tends to trip up beginners. We’ve already created a project, in Chapter 1, so what’s the difference between a project and an app? The difference is that of configuration vs. code:

- A project is an instance of a certain set of Django apps, plus the con- figuration for those apps. Technically, the only requirement of a project is that it supplies a settings file, which defines the database connection information, the list of installed apps, the DIRS, and so forth.
- An app is a portable set of Django functionality, usually including models and views, that lives together in a single Python package.

For example, Django comes with a number of apps, such as the automatic admin interface. A key thing to note about these apps is that they’re portable and reusable across multiple projects.

There are very few hard-and-fast rules about how you fit your Django code into this scheme. If you’re building a simple Web site, you may use only a single app. If you’re building a complex Web site with several unrelated pieces such as an e-commerce system and a message board, you’ll probably want to split those into separate apps so that you’ll be able to reuse them individually in the future.

Indeed, you don’t necessarily need to create apps at all, as evidenced by the example view functions we’ve created so far in this book. In those cases, we simply created a file called views.py, filled it with view functions, and pointed our URLconf at those functions. No “apps” were needed.

However, there’s one requirement regarding the app convention: if you’re using Django’s database layer (models), you must create a Django app. Models must live within apps. Thus, in order to start writing our models, we’ll need to create a new app.

Within the mysite project directory (this is the directory where your manage.py file is not the mysite app directory), type this command to create a books app:

> ```python
> python manage.py startapp books
> ```

This command does not produce any output, but it does create a books direc- tory within the mysite directory. Let’s look at the contents of that directory:

> ```python
> books/ 
> 	/migrations __init__.py 
>     admin.py 
>     models.py 
>     tests.py 
>     views.py
> ```

These files will contain the models and views for this app. Have a look at models.py and views.py in your favorite text editor. Both files are empty, except for comments and an import in models.py. This is the blank slate for your Django app.

## 4.Defining Models in Python

As we discussed earlier in this chapter, the “M” in “MTV” stands for “Model.” A Django model is a description of the data in your database, represented as Python code. It’s your data layout - the equivalent of your SQL CREATE TABLE statements - except it’s in Python instead of SQL, and it includes more than just database column definitions.

Django uses a model to execute SQL code behind the scenes and return convenient Python data structures representing the rows in your database tables. Django also uses models to represent higher-level concepts that SQL can’t necessarily handle.

If you’re familiar with databases, your immediate thought might be, “Isn’t it redundant to define data models in Python instead of in SQL?” Django works the way it does for several reasons:

- Introspection requires overhead and is imperfect. In order to provide convenient data-access APIs, Django needs to know the database layout somehow, and there are two ways of accomplishing this. The first way would be to explicitly describe the data in Python, and the second way would be to introspect the database at runtime to determine the data models.

  This second way seems cleaner, because the metadata about your tables lives in only one place, but it introduces a few problems. First, introspect- ing a database at runtime obviously requires overhead. If the framework had to introspect the database each time it processed a request, or even only when the Web server was initialized, this would incur an unac- ceptable level of overhead. (While some believe that level of overhead is acceptable, Django’s developers aim to trim as much framework overhead as possible.) Second, some databases, notably older versions of MySQL, do not store sufficient metadata for accurate and complete introspection.

- Writing Python is fun, and keeping everything in Python limits the number of times your brain has to do a “context switch.” It helps productivity if you keep yourself in a single programming environment/mentality for as long as possible. Having to write SQL, then Python, and then SQL again is disruptive.

- Having data models stored as code rather than in your database makes it easier to keep your models under version control. This way, you can easily keep track of changes to your data layouts. 

- SQL allows for only a certain level of metadata about a data layout. Most database systems, for example, do not provide a specialized data type for representing email addresses or URLs. Django models do. The advantage of higher-level data types is higher productivity and more reusable code. 

- SQL is inconsistent across database platforms. If you’re distributing a Web application, for example, it’s much more pragmatic to distribute a Python module that describes your data layout than separate sets of CREATE TABLE statements for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. 

A drawback of this approach, however, is that it’s possible for the Python code to get out of sync with what’s actually in the database. If you make changes to a Django model, you’ll need to make the same changes inside your database to keep your database consistent with the model. I’ll show you how to handle this problem when we discuss migrations later in this chapter.

Finally, we should note that Django includes a utility that can generate models by introspecting an existing database. This is useful for quickly getting up and running with legacy data. We’ll cover this in **Chapter 21.

## 5.Your First Model

As an ongoing example in this chapter and the next chapter, we’ll focus on a basic book/author/publisher data layout. We use this as our example because the conceptual relationships between books, authors, and publishers are well known, and this is a common data layout used in introductory SQL textbooks. You’re also reading a book that was written by authors and produced by a publisher! We’ll suppose the following concepts, fields, and relationships:

- An author has a first name, a last name and an email address. 
- A publisher has a name, a street address, a city, a state/province, a country, and a Web site.
- A book has a title and a publication date. It also has one or more authors (a many-to-many relationship with authors) and a single publisher (a one- to-many relationship - aka foreign key - to publishers).

The first step in using this database layout with Django is to express it as Python code. In the models.py file that was created by the startapp command, enter the following:

> ```python
> from django.db import models
>
> class Publisher(models.Model):
>     name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     address = models.CharField(max_length=50)
>     city = models.CharField(max_length=60)
>     state_province = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     country = models.CharField(max_length=50)
>     website = models.URLField()
>
> class Author(models.Model):
>     first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=40)
>     email = models.EmailField()
>
> class Book():
>     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
>     authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
>     publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher)
>     publication_date = models.DateField()
> ```

Let’s quickly examine this code to cover the basics. The first thing to notice is that each model is represented by a Python class that is a subclass of django.db.models.Model. The parent class, Model, contains all the machinery necessary to make these objects capable of interacting with a database - and that leaves our models responsible solely for defining their fields, in a nice and compact syntax.

Believe it or not, this is all the code we need to write to have basic data access with Django. Each model generally corresponds to a single database table, and each attribute on a model generally corresponds to a column in that database table. The attribute name corresponds to the column’s name, and the type of field (e.g., CharField) corresponds to the database column type (e.g., varchar). For example, the Publisher model is equivalent to the following table (assuming PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE syntax):

> ```sql
> CREATE TABLE "books_publisher" ( 
>   "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
>   "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL, 
>   "address" varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
>   "city" varchar(60) NOT NULL,
>   "state_province" varchar(30) NOT NULL, 
>   "country" varchar(50) NOT NULL, 
>   "website" varchar(200) NOT NULL
>
> );
> ```

Indeed, Django can generate that CREATE TABLE statement automatically, as we’ll show you in a moment. The exception to the one-class-per-database- table rule is the case of many-to-many relationships. In our example models, Book has a ManyToManyField called authors. This designates that a book has one or many authors, but the Book database table doesn’t get an authors column. Rather, Django creates an additional table - a many-to-many “join table” - that handles the mapping of books to authors.

For a full list of field types and model syntax options, see Appendix B. Finally, note we haven’t explicitly defined a primary key in any of these models. Unless you instruct it otherwise, Django automatically gives every model an auto- incrementing integer primary key field called id. Each Django model is required to have a single-column primary key.

## 6.Installing the Model

We’ve written the code; now let’s create the tables in our database. In order to do that, the first step is to activate these models in our Django project. We do that by adding the books app to the list of “installed apps” in the settings file. Edit the settings.py file again, and look for the INSTALLED_APPS setting. INSTALLED_APPS tells Django which apps are activated for a given project. By default, it looks something like this:

To register our “books” app, add 'books' to the INSTALLED_APPS list, so the setting ends up looking like this:

> ```python
> INSTALLED_APPS = (
>     'django.contrib.admin',
>     'django.contrib.auth',
>     'django.contrib.contenttypes',
>     'django.contrib.sessions',
>     'django.contrib.messages',
>     'django.contrib.staticfiles',
>     # My Apps
>     'the_site',
>     'books',
> )
> ```

You’ll need to be sure to include the trailing comma in INSTALLED_APPS, because it’s a single-element tuple. By the way, it is best practice to put a comma after every element of a tuple, regardless of whether the tuple has only a single element. This avoids the issue of forgetting commas, and there’s no penalty for using that extra comma.) 'books' refers to the “books” app we’re working on. Each app in INSTALLED_APPS is represented by its full Python path - that is, the path of packages, separated by dots, leading to the app package. Now that the Django app has been activated in the settings file, we can create the database tables in our database. First, let’s validate the models by running this command:

> ```python
> python manage.py check
> ```

The check command runs the Django system check framework - a set of static checks for validating Django projects. If all is well, you’ll see the message System check identified no issues (0 silenced). If you don’t, make sure you typed in the model code correctly. The error output should give you helpful information about what was wrong with the code.

Any time you think you have problems with your models, run python manage.py check. It tends to catch all the common model problems. If your models are valid, run the following command to tell Django that you have made some changes to your models (in this case, you have made a new one):

> ```python
> python manage.py makemigrations books
> ```

You should see something similar to the following:

> ```python
> 0001_initial.py:
>     - Create model Author
>     - Create model Book
>     - Create model Publisher
>     - Add field publisher to book
> ```

Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they’re just files on disk. In this instance, you will find a file names 0001_initial.py in the ‘migrations’ folder of the books app. The migrate command will take your latest migration file and update your database schema automatically, but first, let’s see what SQL that migration would run. The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns their SQL:

> ```python
> python manage.py sqlmigrate books 0001
> ```

You should see something similar to the following (reformatted for readability):

**Note the following:**

- Table names are automatically generated by combining the name of the app (books) and the lowercase name of the model (publisher, book, and author). You can override this behavior, as detailed in Appendix B.
- As we mentioned earlier, Django adds a primary key for each table automatically - the id fields. You can override this, too. 
- By convention, Django appends "_id" to the foreign key field name. As you might have guessed, you can override this behavior, too. 
- The foreign key relationship is made explicit by a REFERENCES statement. 
- These CREATE TABLE statements are tailored to the database you’re using, so database-specific field types such as auto_increment (MySQL), serial (PostgreSQL), or integer primary key (SQLite) are handled for you auto- matically. The same goes for quoting of column names (e.g., using double quotes or single quotes). This example output is in PostgreSQL syntax.

The sqlmigrate command doesn’t actually create the tables or otherwise touch your database - it just prints output to the screen so you can see what SQL Django would execute if you asked it. If you wanted to, you could copy and paste this SQL into your database client, however Django provides an easier way of committing the SQL to the database: the migrate command:

> ```python
> (env_mysite) Gaowei:MasteringDjango Gaowei$ python manage.py migrate
> ```

Run that command, and you’ll see something like this:

> ```python
> Operations to perform:
>   Synchronize unmigrated apps: staticfiles, messages
>   Apply all migrations: contenttypes, admin, sessions, auth, books
> Synchronizing apps without migrations:
>   Creating tables...
>     Running deferred SQL...
>   Installing custom SQL...
> Running migrations:
>   Rendering model states... DONE
>   Applying books.0001_initial... OK
> ```

In case you were wondering what all the extras are (commented out above), the first time you run migrate, Django will also create all the system tables that Django needs for the inbuilt apps. Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, however there are some caveats. For more information on migrations, see Chapter 21.

## 7.Basic Data Access

Once you’ve created a model, Django automatically provides a high-level Python API for working with those models. Try it out by running python manage.py shell and typing the following:

> ```python
> >>> from books.models import Publisher
> >>> p1 = Publisher(name='Apress', address='2855 Telegraph Avenue',
> ...     city='Berkeley', state_province='CA',country="U.S.A",
> ...     website='http://www.oreilly.com/')
> >>> p1.save()
> >>> p2 = Publisher(name="O'Reilly", address='10 Fawcett St.',
> ...     city='Cambridge', state_province='MA', country='U.S.A',
> ...     website='http://www.oreilly.com/')
> >>> p2.save()
> >>> publisher_list = Publisher.objects.all()
> >>> publisher_list
> [<Publisher: Publisher object>, <Publisher: Publisher object>]
> ```

These few lines of code accomplish quite a bit. Here are the highlights:

- First, we import our Publisher model class. This lets us interact with the database table that contains publishers. 
- We create a Publisher object by instantiating it with values for each field - name, address, etc. 
- To save the object to the database, call its save() method. Behind the scenes, Django executes an SQL INSERT statement here. 
- To retrieve publishers from the database, use the attribute Publisher.objects, which you can think of as a set of all publishers. Fetch a list of all Publisher objects in the database with the statement Publisher.objects.all(). Behind the scenes, Django executes an SQL SELECT statement here.

One thing is worth mentioning, in case it wasn’t clear from this example. When you’re creating objects using the Django model API, Django doesn’t save the objects to the database until you call the save() method:

> ```python
> p1 = Publisher(...) # At this point, p1 is not saved to the database yet! p1.save() # Now it is.
> ```

If you want to create an object and save it to the database in a single step, use the objects.create() method. This example is equivalent to the example above:

> ```python
> p1 = Publisher.objects.create(name='Apress',
> ```

Naturally, you can do quite a lot with the Django database API - but first, let’s take care of a small annoyance.

## 8.Adding Model String Representations

When we printed out the list of publishers, all we got was this unhelpful display that makes it difficult to tell the Publisher objects apart:

`[<Publisher: Publisher object>, <Publisher: Publisher object>]`

We can fix this easily by adding a method called __str__() to our Publisher class. A __str__() method tells Python how to display a human-readable representation of an object. You can see this in action by adding a __str__() method to the three models:

> ```python
> from django.db import models
>
> class Publisher(models.Model):
>     name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     address = models.CharField(max_length=50)
>     city = models.CharField(max_length=60)
>     state_province = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     country = models.CharField(max_length=50)
>     website = models.URLField()
>
>     def __str__(self):
>         return self.name
>
> class Author(models.Model):
>     first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=40)
>     email = models.EmailField()
>
>     def __str__(self):
>         return "%s %s" %(self.first_name, self.last_name)
>
> class Book(models.Model):
>     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
>     authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
>     publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher)
>     publication_date = models.DateField()
>
>     def __str__(self):
>         return self.title
> ```

As you can see, a `__str__() `method can do whatever it needs to do in order to return a representation of an object. Here, the `__str__() `methods for Publisher and Book simply return the object’s name and title, respectively, but the `__str_()` for Author is slightly more complex - it pieces together the first_name and last_name fields, separated by a space. The only requirement for`__str__()` is that it return a string object. If `__str__() `doesn’t return a string object - if it returns, say, an integer - then Python will raise a TypeError with a message like:

> ```python
> TypeError: __str__ returned non-string (type int).
> ```

For the __str__() changes to take effect, exit out of the Python shell and enter it again with python manage.py shell. (This is the simplest way to make code changes take effect.) Now the list of Publisher objects is much easier to understand:

> ```python
> >>> from books.models import Publisher 
> >>> publisher_list = Publisher.objects.all() 
> >>> publisher_list [<Publisher: Apress>, <Publisher: O'Reilly>]
> ```

Make sure any model you define has a` __str__()` method - not only for your own convenience when using the interactive interpreter, but also because Django uses the output of `__str__() `in several places when it needs to display objects. Finally, note that `__str__()` is a good example of adding behavior to models. A Django model describes more than the database table layout for an object; it also describes any functionality that object knows how to do. `__str__()` is one example of such functionality - a model knows how to display itself.

## 9.Inserting and Updating data

You’ve already seen this done: to insert a row into your database, first create an instance of your model using keyword arguments, like so:

> ```python
> p = Publisher(name='Apress',
>         address='2855 Telegraph Avenue',
>         city='Berkeley',
>         state_province='CA',
>         country="U.S.A",
>         website='http://www.oreilly.com/'
> ```

As we noted above, this act of instantiating a model class does not touch the database. The record isn’t saved into the database until you call save(), like this:

> ```python
> >>> p.save()
> ```

In SQL, this can roughly be translated into the following:

> ```python
> INSERT INTO books_publisher
> 	(name, address, city, state_province, country, website) 
> VALUES 
> 	('Apress', '2855 Telegraph Ave.', 'Berkeley', 'CA', 'U.S.A.', 'http://www.apress.com/');
> ```

Because the Publisher model uses an autoincrementing primary key id, the initial call to save() does one more thing: it calculates the primary key value for the record and sets it to the id attribute on the instance:

> ```python
> >>> p.id 
> 52 # this will differ based on your own data
> ```

Subsequent calls to save() will save the record in place, without creating a new record (i.e., performing an SQL UPDATE statement instead of an INSERT):

> ```python
> >>> p.name = 'Apress Publishing' >>> p.save()
> ```

The preceding save() statement will result in roughly the following SQL:

> ```python
> UPDATE books_publisher SET 
> 	name = 'Apress Publishing', 
>     address = '2855 Telegraph Ave.', 
>     city = 'Berkeley', 
>     state_province = 'CA', 
>     country = 'U.S.A.', 
>     website = 'http://www.apress.com' 
> WHERE id = 52;
> ```

Yes, note that all of the fields will be updated, not just the ones that have been changed. Depending on your application, this may cause a race condition. See “Updating Multiple Objects in One Statement” below to find out how to execute this (slightly different) query:

> ```python
> UPDATE books_publisher SET
> name = 'Apress Publishing' WHERE id=52;
> ```

## 10.Selecting objects

Knowing how to create and update database records is essential, but chances are that the Web applications you’ll build will be doing more querying of existing objects than creating new ones. We’ve already seen a way to retrieve every record for a given model:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.all() 
> [<Publisher: Apress>, <Publisher: O'Reilly>]
> ```

This roughly translates to this SQL:

> ```python
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher;
> ```

> **Note:**
>
> Notice that Django doesn’t use SELECT * when looking up data and instead lists all fields explicitly. This is by design: in certain circum- stances SELECT * can be slower, and (more important) listing fields more closely follows one tenet of the Zen of Python: “Explicit is better than implicit.”
>
> For more on the Zen of Python, try typing import this at a Python prompt.

Let’s take a close look at each part of this Publisher.objects.all() line:

- First, we have the model we defined, Publisher. No surprise here: when you want to look up data, you use the model for that data. 

- Next, we have the objects attribute. This is called a manager. Managers are discussed in detail in Chapter 09. For now, all you need to know is that managers take care of all “table-level” operations on data including, most important, data lookup.

  All models automatically get a objects manager; you’ll use it any time you want to look up model instances.

- Finally, we have all(). This is a method on the objects manager that returns all the rows in the database. Though this object looks like a list, it’s actually a QuerySet - an object that represents a specific set of rows from the database. Appendix C deals with QuerySets in detail. For the rest of this chapter, we’ll just treat them like the lists they emulate.

Any database lookup is going to follow this general pattern - we’ll call methods on the manager attached to the model we want to query against.

###   (1)Filtering Data

Naturally, it’s rare to want to select everything from a database at once; in most cases, you’ll want to deal with a subset of your data. In the Django API, you can filter your data using the filter() method:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.filter(name='Apress') 
> [<Publisher: Apress>]
> ```

**filter()** takes keyword arguments that get translated into the appropriate SQL WHERE clauses. The preceding example would get translated into something like this:

> ```python
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher 
> WHERE name = 'Apress';
> ```

You can pass multiple arguments into filter() to narrow down things further:

> ```python
>
> ```

Those multiple arguments get translated into SQL AND clauses. Thus, the example in the code snippet translates into the following:

> ```python
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher 
> WHERE country = 'U.S.A.' 
> AND state_province = 'CA';
> ```

Notice that by default the lookups use the SQL = operator to do exact match lookups. Other lookup types are available:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.filter(name__contains="press") 
> [<Publisher: Apress>]
> ```

That’s a double underscore there between name and contains. Like Python itself, Django uses the double underscore to signal that something “magic” is happening - here, the __contains part gets translated by Django into a SQL LIKE statement:

> ```python
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher 
> WHERE name LIKE '%press%';
> ```

Many other types of lookups are available, including icontains (case-insensitive LIKE), startswith and endswith, and range (SQL BETWEEN queries). Appendix C describes all of these lookup types in detail.

###   (2)Retrieving Single Objects

The filter() examples above all returned a QuerySet, which you can treat like a list. Sometimes it’s more convenient to fetch only a single object, as opposed to a list. That’s what the get() method is for:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.get(name="Apress") 
> <Publisher: Apress>
> ```

Instead of a list (rather, QuerySet), only a single object is returned. Because of that, a query resulting in multiple objects will cause an exception:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.get(country="U.S.A.") Traceback (most recent call last):
>
> ... MultipleObjectsReturned: get() returned more than one Publisher -- it returned 2! Lookup parameters were {'country': 'U.S.A.'}
> ```

A query that returns no objects also causes an exception:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.get(name="Penguin") 
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>
> ... 
> DoesNotExist: Publisher matching query does not exist.
> ```

The DoesNotExist exception is an attribute of the model’s class - Publisher.DoesNotExist. In your applications, you’ll want to trap these exceptions, like this:

> ```python
> try:
> 	p = Publisher.objects.get(name='Apress') 
> except Publisher.DoesNotExist:
> 	print ("Apress isn't in the database yet.") 
> else: 
>     print ("Apress is in the database.")
> ```

###   (3)Ordering Data

As you play around with the previous examples, you might discover that the objects are being returned in a seemingly random order. You aren’t imagining things; so far we haven’t told the database how to order its results, so we’re simply getting back data in some arbitrary order chosen by the database. In your Django applications, you’ll probably want to order your results according to a certain value - say, alphabetically. To do this, use the order_by() method:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by("name") 
> [<Publisher: Apress>, <Publisher: O'Reilly>]
> ```

This doesn’t look much different from the earlier **all()** example, but the **SQL** now includes a specific ordering:

> ```sql
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
>
> FROM books_publisher 
>
> ORDER BY name;
> ```

You can order by any field you like:

> ```sql
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by("address") 
> [<Publisher: O'Reilly>, <Publisher: Apress>]
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by("state_province") 
>  [<Publisher: Apress>, <Publisher: O'Reilly>]
> ```

To order by multiple fields (where the second field is used to disambiguate ordering in cases where the first is the same), use multiple arguments:

> ```sql
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by("state_province", "address") 
> [<Publisher: Apress>, <Publisher: O'Reilly>]
> ```

You can also specify reverse ordering by prefixing the field name with a - (that’s a minus character):

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by("-name") 
> [<Publisher: O'Reilly>, <Publisher: Apress>]
> ```

While this flexibility is useful, using order_by() all the time can be quite repetitive. Most of the time you’ll have a particular field you usually want to order by. In these cases, Django lets you specify a default ordering in the model:

> ```python
> class Publisher(models.Model):
>     name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     address = models.CharField(max_length=50)
>     city = models.CharField(max_length=60)
>     state_province = models.CharField(max_length=30)
>     country = models.CharField(max_length=50)
>     website = models.URLField()
>
>     def __str__(self):
>         return self.name
>
>     class Meta:
>         ordering = ['name']
> ```

Here, we’ve introduced a new concept: the class Meta, which is a class that’s embedded within the Publisher class definition (i.e., it’s indented to be within class Publisher). You can use this Meta class on any model to specify various model-specific options. A full reference of Meta options is available in Appendix B, but for now, we’re concerned with the ordering option. If you specify this, it tells Django that unless an ordering is given explicitly with order_by(), all Publisher objects should be ordered by the name field whenever they’re retrieved with the Django database API.

###   (4)Chaining Lookups

You’ve seen how you can filter data, and you’ve seen how you can order it. Often, of course, you’ll need to do both. In these cases, you simply “chain” the lookups together:

> ```sql
> >>> Publisher.objects.filter(country="U.S.A.").order_by("-name") 
> [<Publisher: O'Reilly>, <Publisher: Apress>]
> ```

As you might expect, this translates to a SQL query with both a WHERE and an ORDER BY:

> ```sql
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher 
> WHERE country = 'U.S.A' 
> ORDER BY name DESC;
> ```

###   (5)Slicing Data

Another common need is to look up only a fixed number of rows. Imagine you have thousands of publishers in your database, but you want to display only the first one. You can do this using Python’s standard list slicing syntax:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by('name')[0] 
> <Publisher: Apress>
> ```

This translates roughly to:

> ```sql
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher 
> ORDER BY name LIMIT 1;
> ```

Similarly, you can retrieve a specific subset of data using Python’s range-slicing syntax:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by('name')[0:2]
> ```

This returns two objects, translating roughly to:

> ```sql
> SELECT id, name, address, city, state_province, country, website 
> FROM books_publisher 
> ORDER BY name 
> OFFSET 0 LIMIT 2;
> ```

Note that negative slicing is not supported:

> ```sql
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by('name')[-1] 
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>
> ... AssertionError: Negative indexing is not supported.
> ```

This is easy to get around, though. Just change the order_by() statement, like this:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.order_by('-name')[0]
> ```

###   (6)Updating Multiple Objects in One Statement

We pointed out in the “Inserting and Updating Data” section that the model save() method updates all columns in a row. Depending on your application, you may want to update only a subset of columns. For example, let’s say we want to update the Apress Publisher to change the name from 'Apress' to 'Apress Publishing'. Using save(), it would look something like this:

> ```python
> >>> p = Publisher.objects.get(name='Apress') 
> >>> p.name = 'Apress Publishing' 
> >>> p.save()
> ```

(Note that this example assumes Apress has a publisher ID of 52.) You can see in this example that Django’s save() method sets all of the column values, not just the name column. If you’re in an environment where other columns of the database might change due to some other process, it’s smarter to change only the column you need to change. To do this, use the update() method on QuerySet objects. Here’s an example:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.filter(id=52).update(name='Apress Publishing')
> ```

The SQL translation here is much more efficient and has no chance of race conditions:

> ```sql
> UPDATE books_publisher 
> SET name = 'Apress Publishing' 
> WHERE id = 52;
> ```

The update() method works on any QuerySet, which means you can edit multi- ple records in bulk. Here’s how you might change the country from 'U.S.A.' to USA in each Publisher record:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.all().update(country='USA') 
> 2
> ```

The update() method has a return value - an integer representing how many records changed. In the above example, we got 2.

## 11.Deleting objects

To delete an object from your database, simply call the object’s delete() method:

> ```python
> >>> p = Publisher.objects.get(name="O'Reilly") >>> p.delete() >>> Publisher.objects.all() [<Publisher: Apress Publishing>]
> ```

You can also delete objects in bulk by calling delete() on the result of any QuerySet. This is similar to the update() method we showed in the last section:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.filter(country='USA').delete() 
> >>> Publisher.objects.all().delete() 
> >>> Publisher.objects.all() []
> ```

Be careful deleting your data! As a precaution against deleting all of the data in a particular table, Django requires you to explicitly use all() if you want to delete everything in your table. For example, this won’t work:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.delete() Traceback (most recent call last):
> File "", line 1, in AttributeError: 'Manager' object has no attribute 'delete'
> ```

But it’ll work if you add the all() method:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.all().delete()
> ```

If you’re just deleting a subset of your data, you don’t need to include all(). To repeat a previous example:

> ```python
> >>> Publisher.objects.filter(country='USA').delete()
> ```

## 12.What's Next?

Having read this chapter, you have enough knowledge of Django models to be able to write basic database applications. Chapter 9 will provide some information on more advanced usage of Django’s database layer. Once you’ve defined your models, the next step is to populate your database with data. You might have legacy data, in which case Chapter 21 will give you advice about integrating with legacy databases. You might rely on site users to supply your data, in which case Chapter 6 will teach you how to process user-submitted form data. But in some cases, you or your team might need to enter data manually, in which case it would be helpful to have a Web-based interface for entering and managing data. The next chapter covers Django’s admin interface, which exists precisely for that reason.
