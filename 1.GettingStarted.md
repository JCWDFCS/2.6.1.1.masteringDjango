# 1.Getting Started

## Installing Django

This will instruct pip to install Django into your virtual environment. Your command output should look like this:

> ```python
> (env_mysite) Gaowei:MasteringDjango Gaowei$ pip install django==1.8.13
> Collecting django==1.8.13
>   Downloading Django-1.8.13-py2.py3-none-any.whl (6.2MB)
>     100% |████████████████████████████████| 6.2MB 132kB/s
> ```

## Setting Up a Database

This step is not necessary in order to complete any of the examples in this book. Django comes with SQLite installed by default. SQLite requires no configuration on your part. If you would like to work with a “large” database engine like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle, see Chapter 21.

## Starting a Project

These files are:

1. The outer mysite/ root directory is just a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like. 
2. **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about manage.py on the Django Project website 8 . 
3. The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls). 
4. **mysite/init.py:** An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. (Read more about packages 9 in the official Python docs if you’re a Python beginner.) 
5. **mysite/settings.py**: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Ap- pendix D will tell you all about how settings work. 
6. **mysite/urls.py:** The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in Chapters 2 and 7. 
7. **mysite/wsgi.py:** An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See Chapter 13 for more details.

## Django settings

By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:

```python
TIME_ZONE = 'Asia/Shanghai'
```

-  django.contrib.admin – The admin site. 
- django.contrib.auth – An authentication system.
-  django.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types. 
- django.contrib.sessions – A session framework.
- django.contrib.messages – A messaging framework. 
- django.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files.

These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case. Some of these applications makes use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:

## The development server

Automatic reloading of runserver

The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed. You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.



## The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern

MVC has been around as a concept for a long time, but has seen exponential growth since the advent of the Internet because it is the best way to design client-server applications. All of the best web frameworks are built around the MVC concept. At the risk of starting a flame war, I contest that if you are not using MVC to design web apps, you are doing it wrong. As concept, the MVC design pattern is really simple to understand:

- **The model(M)** is a model or representation of your data. It is not the actual data, but an interface to the data. The model allows you to pull data from your database without having to know the intricacies of the underlying database. The model usually also provides an abstraction layer with your database, so that you can use the same model with multiple databases. 
- **The view(V)** is what you see. It is the presentation layer for your model. On your computer, the view is what you see in the browser for a Web app, or the UI for a desktop app. The view also provides an interface to collect user input. 
- **The controller(C)** controls the flow of information between the model and the view. It uses programmed logic to decide what information is pulled from the database via the model and what information is passed to the view. It also gets information from the user via the view and implements business logic: either by changing the view, or modifying data through the model, or both.

Where it gets difficult is the vastly different interpretation of what actually happens at each layer - different frameworks implement the same functionality in different ways. One framework “guru” might say a certain function belongs in a view, while an other might vehemently defend the need for it to be in the controller.

You, as a budding programmer who Gets Stuff Done, do not have to care about this because in the end, it doesn’t matter. As long as you understand how Django implements the MVC pattern, you are free to move on and get some real work done. Although, watching a flame war in a comment thread can be a highly amusing distraction…

Django follows the MVC pattern closely, however it does implement it’s own logic in the implementation. Because the “C” is handled by the framework itself and most of the excitement in Django happens in models, templates and views, Django is often referred to as an MTV framework. In the MTV development pattern:

- **M stands for “Model,”** the data access layer. This layer contains anything and everything about the data: how to access it, how to validate it, whichbehaviors it has, and the relationships between the data. We will be looking closely at Django’s models in Chapter 4.
- **T stands for “Template,”** the presentation layer. This layer contains pre- sentation-related decisions: how something should be displayed on a Web page or other type of document. We will explore Django’s templates in Chapter 3. 
- **V stands for “View,”** the business logic layer. This layer contains the logic that access the model and defers to the appropriate template(s). You can think of it as the bridge between models and templates. We will be checking out Django’s views in the next chapter.

This is probably the only unfortunate bit of naming in Django, because Django’s view is more like the controller in MVC, and MVC’s view is actually a Template in Django. It is a little confusing at first, but as a programmer getting a job done, you really won’t care for long. It is only a problem for those of us who have to teach it. Oh, and to the flamers of course.
