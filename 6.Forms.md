# 6.Forms

## 1.Getting Data From the Request Object

HTML forms are the backbone of interactive Web sites, from the simplicity of Google’s single search box to ubiquitous blog comment-submission forms to complex custom data-entry interfaces.

This chapter covers how you can use Django to access user-submitted form data, validate it and do something with it. Along the way, we’ll cover HttpRequest and Form objects.

###   (1)Information About the URL

HttpRequest objects contain several pieces of information about the currently requested URL:

**Attribute/method** Description Example

**request.path** The full path, not including the domain but including the leading slash. "/hello/"

**request.get_host**() The host (i.e., the “domain,” in common parlance). "127.0.0.1:8000" or "www.example.com"

request.get_full_path() The path, plus a query string (if available). "/hel- lo/?print=true"

**request.is_secure**() True if the request was made via HTTPS. Otherwise, False. True or False Always use these attributes/methods instead of hard-coding URLs in your views. This makes for more flexible code that can be reused in other places. A simplistic example:

> ```python
> # BAD! 
> def current_url_view_bad(request): 
>     return HttpResponse("Welcome to the page at /current/")
>
> # GOOD 
> def current_url_view_good(request): 
>     return HttpResponse("Welcome to the page at %s" % request.path)
> ```

###   (2)Other Information About the Request

request.META is a Python dictionary containing all available HTTP headers for the given request - including the user’s IP address and user agent (generally the name and version of the Web browser). Note that the full list of available headers depends on which headers the user sent and which headers your Web server sets. Some commonly available keys in this dictionary are:

- HTTP_REFERER - The referring URL, if any. (Note the misspelling of REFERER.) 
- HTTP_USER_AGENT - The user’s browser’s user-agent string, if any. This looks something like: "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr-FR; rv:1.8.1.17)Gecko/20080829 Firefox/2.0.0.17". 
- REMOTE_ADDR - The IP address of the client, e.g., "12.345.67.89". (If there quest has passed through any proxies, then this might be a comma- separated list of IP addresses, e.g., "12.345.67.89,23.456.78.90".)

Note that because request.META is just a basic Python dictionary, you’ll get a KeyError exception if you try to access a key that doesn’t exist. (Because HTTP headers are external data - that is, they’re submitted by your users’ browsers - they shouldn’t be trusted, and you should always design your application to fail gracefully if a particular header is empty or doesn’t exist.) You should either use a try/except clause or the get() method to handle the case of undefined keys:

> ```python
> def ua_display_bad(request):
>     ua = request.META['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] # Might raise KeyError!
>     return HttpResponse("Your browser is %s" % ua)
>
> # GOOD (VERSION 1)
> def ua_display_good1(request):
>     try:
>         ua = request.META['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
>     except KeyError:
>         ua = 'unknown'
>     return HttpResponse("Your browser is %s" % ua)
>
> # GOOD (VERSION 2)
> def ua_display_good2(request):
>     ua = request.META.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT', 'unknown')
>     return HttpResponse("Your browser is %s" % ua)
> ```

We encourage you to write a small view that displays all of the request.META data so you can get to know what’s in there. Here’s what that view might look like:

> ```python
> def display_meta(request):
>     values = request.META.items()
>     values.sort() html = []
>     for k, v in values:
>         html.append('<tr><td>%s</td><td>%s</td></tr>' % (k, v))
>     return HttpResponse('<table>%s</table>' % '\n'.join(html))
> ```

Another good way to see what sort of information that the request object contains is to look closely at the Django error pages when you crash the system - there is a wealth of useful information in there - including all the HTTP headers and other request objects (request.path for example).

###   (3)Information About Submitted Data

Beyond basic metadata about the request, HttpRequest objects have two at- tributes that contain information submitted by the user: request.GET and request.POST. Both of these are dictionary-like objects that give you access to GET and POST data.

> **Dictionary-like objects**
>
> When we say request.GET and request.POST are “dictionary-like” objects, we mean that they behave like standard Python dictionaries but aren’t technically dictionaries under the hood. For example, request.GET and request.POST both have get(), keys() and values() methods, and you can iterate over the keys by doing for key in request.GET.
>
> So why the distinction? Because both request.GET and request.POST have additional methods that normal dictionaries don’t have. We’ll get into these in a short while.
>
> You might have encountered the similar term “file-like objects” - Python objects that have a few basic methods, like read(), that let them act as stand-ins for “real” file objects.

POST data generally is submitted from an HTML <form>, while GET data can come from a <form> or the query string in the page’s URL.

## 2.A Simple Form-Handling Example

The accompanying template, search_form.html, could look like this:

> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
>   <head>
>     <meta charset="utf-8">
>     <title>Search</title>
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     <form class="" action="/search/" method="get">
>       <input type="text" name="q" value="">
>       <input type="submit" name="" value="Search">
>     </form>
>   </body>
> </html>
> ```

For the moment, this merely displays the user’s search term, so we can make sure the data is being submitted to Django properly, and so you can get a feel for how the search term flows through the system. In short:

> ```python
> from django.shortcuts import render
> from django.http import HttpResponse
>
> def search_form(request):
>     return render(request, 'books/search_form.html')
>
> def search(request):
>     if 'q' in request.GET:
>         message = 'You search for: %r' %request.GET['q']
>     else:
>         message = 'You submitted an empty form.'
>     return HttpResponse(message)
> ```

1. The HTML <form> defines a variable q. When it’s submitted, the value of q is sent via GET (method="get") to the URL /search/. 
2. The Django view that handles the URL /search/ (search()) has access to the q value in request.GET.

An important thing to point out here is that we explicitly check that 'q' exists in request.GET. As we pointed out in the request.META section above, you shouldn’t trust anything submitted by users or even assume that they’ve submitted anything in the first place. If we didn’t add this check, any submission of an empty form would raise KeyError in the view:

###  (1)Query string parameters

> ```python
> from django.shortcuts import render
> from django.http import HttpResponse
> from .models import Book
>
> def search_form(request):
>     return render(request, 'books/search_form.html')
>
> def search(request):
>     if 'q' in request.GET and request.GET['q']:
>         q = request.GET['q']
>         books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
>         context = {'books':books, 'query':q}
>         # message = 'You search for: %r' %request.GET['q']
>         return render(request, 'search_result.html', context)
>     else:
>         return HttpResponse('Please submit a search term.')
> ```

A couple of notes on what we did here:

- Aside from checking that 'q' exists in request.GET, we also make sure that request.GET['q'] is a non-empty value before passing it to the database query. 
- We’re using Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q) to query our book table for all books whose title includes the given submission. The icon- tains is a lookup type (as explained in Chapter 4 and Appendix B), and the statement can be roughly translated as “Get the books whose title contains q, without being case-sensitive.”

This is a very simple way to do a book search. We wouldn’t recommend using a simple icontains query on a large production database, as it can be slow. (In the real world, you’d want to use a custom search system of some sort. Search the Web for open-source full-text search to get an idea of the possibilities.) * We pass books, a list of Book objects, to the template. The search_results.html file might include something like this:

> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
>   <head>
>     <meta charset="utf-8">
>     <title>Book Search</title>
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     <p>You search for: <strong>{{ query }}</strong></p>
>
>     {% if  books %}
>       <p>Found {{ books|length }} book {{ books|pluralize }}. </p>
>       <ul>
>         {% for book in books  %}
>         <li> {{ book.title }}</li>
>         {% endfor %}
>       </ul>
>     {% else %}
>       <p>No books matched your search criteria.</p>
>
>     {% endif %}
>
>   </body>
> </html>
> ```

## 3.Improving Our Simple Form-Handling Example

As in previous chapters, we’ve shown you the simplest thing that could possibly work. Now we’ll point out some problems and show you how to improve it. First, our search() view’s handling of an empty query is poor - we’re just displaying a "Please submit a search term." message, requiring the user to hit the browser’s back button.

This is horrid and unprofessional, and if you ever actually implement something like this in the wild, your Django privileges will be revoked. It would be much better to redisplay the form, with an error above it, so that the user can try again immediately. The easiest way to do that would be to render the template again, like this:

> ```python
> from django.shortcuts import render
> from django.http import HttpResponse
> from .models import Book
>
> def search_form(request):
>     return render(request, 'books/search_form.html')
>
> def search(request):
>     if 'q' in request.GET and request.GET['q']:
>         q = request.GET['q']
>         books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
>         context = {'books':books, 'query':q}
>         # message = 'You search for: %r' %request.GET['q']
>         return render(request, 'search_result.html', context)
>     else:
>         return render(request, 'search_form.html', {'error':True})
> ```

We can still use this template from our original view, search_form(), because search_form() doesn’t pass error to the template - so the error message won’t show up in that case. With this change in place, it’s a better application, but it now begs the question: is a dedicated search_form() view really necessary?

As it stands, a request to the URL /search/ (without any GET parameters) will display the empty form (but with an error). We can remove the search_form() view, along with its associated URLpattern, as long as we change search() to hide the error message when somebody visits /search/ with no GET parameters:

> ```python
>
> ```

In this updated view, if a user visits /search/ with no GET parameters, he’ll see the search form with no error message. If a user submits the form with an empty value for 'q', he’ll see the search form with an error message. And, finally, if a user submits the form with a non-empty value for 'q', he’ll see the search results.

We can make one final improvement to this application, to remove a bit of redundancy. Now that we’ve rolled the two views and URLs into one and /search/ handles both search-form display and result display, the HTML <form> in search_form.html doesn’t have to hard-code a URL. Instead of this:

> ```python
> <form action="/search/" method="get">
> ```

It can be changed to this:

> ```python
> <form action="" method="get">
> ```

The action="" means “Submit the form to the same URL as the current page.” With this change in place, you won’t have to remember to change the action if you ever hook the search() view to another URL.

## 4.Simple validation

Our search example is still reasonably simple, particularly in terms of its data validation; we’re merely checking to make sure the search query isn’t empty. Many HTML forms include a level of validation that’s more complex than making sure the value is non-empty. We’ve all seen the error messages on Web sites:

- “Please enter a valid e-mail address. ‘foo’ is not an e-mail address.” 
- “Please enter a valid five-digit U.S. ZIP code. ‘123’ is not a ZIP code.” 
- “Please enter a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.” 
-  “Please enter a password that is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one number.”

> **A note on JavaScript validation****
>
> ****This is beyond the scope of this book, but you can use JavaScript to validate data on the client side, directly in the browser. But be warned: even if you do this, you must validate data on the server side, too. Some people have JavaScript turned off, and some malicious users might submit raw, unvalidated data directly to your form handler to see whether they can cause mischief.
>
> There’s nothing you can do about this, other than always validate user-submitted data server-side (i.e., in your Django views). You should think of JavaScript validation as a bonus usability feature, not as your only means of validating.

Let’s tweak our search() view so that it validates that the search term is less than or equal to 20 characters long. (For sake of example, let’s say anything longer than that might make the query too slow.) How might we do that?

The simplest possible thing would be to embed the logic directly in the view, like this:

> ```python
> def search(request):
>     error = False
>     if 'q' in request.GET:
>         q = request.GET['q']
>         if not q:
>             error = True
>         elif len(q) > 20:
>             error = True
>         else:
>             books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=q)
>             context = {'books':books, 'query':q}
>             # message = 'You search for: %r' %request.GET['q']
>             return render(request, 'books/search_results.html', context)
>     else:
>         return render(request, 'books/search_form.html', {'error':error})
>
> ```

Now, if you try submitting a search query greater than 20 characters long, it won’t let you search; you’ll get an error message. But that error message in search_form.html currently says "Please submit a search term." - so we’ll have to change it to be accurate for both cases:

## 5.Making a Contact Form

Although we iterated over the book search form example several times and improved it nicely, it’s still fundamentally simple: just a single field, 'q'. As forms get more complex, we have to repeat the above steps over and over again for each form field we use. This introduces a lot of cruft and a lot of opportunities for human error. Lucky for us, the Django developers thought of this and built into Django a higher-level library that handles form- and validation-related tasks.

###   (1)Your First Form Class

Django comes with a form library, called django.forms, that handles many of the issues we’ve been exploring this chapter - from HTML form display to validation. Let’s dive in and rework our contact form application using the Django forms framework.

The primary way to use the forms framework is to define a Form class for each HTML <form> you’re dealing with. In our case, we only have one <form>, so we’ll have one Form class. This class can live anywhere you want - including directly in your views.py file - but community convention is to keep Form classes in a separate file called forms.py.

Create this file in the same directory as your mysite/views.py, and enter the following:

> ```python
> from django import forms
>
> class ContactForm(forms.Form):
>     subject = forms.CharField()
>     email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
>     message = forms.CharField()
> ```

This is pretty intuitive, and it’s similar to Django’s model syntax. Each field in the form is represented by a type of Field class - CharField and EmailField are the only types of fields used here - as attributes of a Form class. Each field is required by default, so to make email optional, we specify required=False. Let’s hop into the Python interactive interpreter and see what this class can do. The first thing it can do is display itself as HTML:

## 6.Tying Form Objects Into Views

Our contact form is not much good to us unless we have some way of displaying it to the user. To do this, we need to first update our mysite/views:

Next, we have to create our contact form (save this to mysite/templates):



> ```python
> from django.shortcuts import render
> # from django.http import HttpResponse
> from .models import Book
> from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
> from .forms import ContactForm
> from django.core.mail import send_mail
> def contact(request):
>     if request.method == 'POST'
>     form = ContactForm(request.POST)
>     if form.is_valid():
>         cd = form.cleaned_data
>         send_mail(
>         cd['subject'],
>         cd['message'],
>         cd.get('email', 'noreply@example.com'),
>         ['siteowner@example.com'],
>         )
>         return HttpResponseRedirect('/contact/thanks/')
>     else:
>         form = ContactForm()
>     return render(request, 'contact_form.html', {'form': form})
> ```

Next, we have to create our contact form (save this to mysite/templates):

> ```python
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     <h1>Contact us</h1>
>     {% if form.errors %}
>       <p style='color:red'>
>         Please correct the error{{ form.errors|pluralize }} below.
>       </p>
>     {% endif %}
>     <form class="" action="" method="post">
>       <table>
>         {{ form.as_table }}
>       </table>
>       {{% csrf_token %}}
>       <input type="submit" name="" value="Submit">
>
>     </form>
>
>   </body>
> </html>
> ```

And finally, we need to change our urls.py to display our contact form at /contact/.

> ```python
> from django.conf.urls import url
> from . import views
>
> urlpatterns = [
>     url(r'^search-form/$', views.search_form, name='search_form'),
>     url(r'^search/$', views.search),
>     url(r'^contact/$', views.contact),
> ]
> ```

Since we’re creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry too hard, because Django comes with a very easy-to-use system for protecting against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} template tag. More details about {% csrf_- token %} can be found in Chapter 19.

Try running this locally. Load the form, submit it with none of the fields filled out, submit it with an invalid e-mail address, then finally submit it with valid data. (Of course, unless you have configured a mail-server, you will get a ConnectionRefusedError when send_mail() is called, but that’s another issue.)

## 7.Changing How Fields Are Rendered

Probably the first thing you’ll notice when you render this form locally is that the message field is displayed as an <input type="text">, and it ought to be a <textarea>. We can fix that by setting the field’s widget:

> ```python
> from django import forms
>
> class ContactForm(forms.Form):
>     subject = forms.CharField()
>     email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
>     message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
>
> f = ContactForm({'subject':'Hello', 'email':'gaowei@gmail.com', 'message':'N\ice site'})
> ```

The forms framework separates out the presentation logic for each field into a set of widgets. Each field type has a default widget, but you can easily override the default, or provide a custom widget of your own. Think of the Field classes as representing validation logic, while widgets represent presentation logic.

## 8.Setting a Maximum Length

One of the most common validation needs is to check that a field is of a certain size. For good measure, we should improve our ContactForm to limit the subject to 100 characters. To do that, just supply a max_length to the CharField, like this:

> ```python
> class ContactForm(forms.Form):
>     subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
>     email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
>     message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
>
> f = ContactForm({'subject':'Hello', 'email':'gaowei@gmail.com', 'message':'N\ice site'})
> ```

An optional min_length argument is also available.

## 9.Setting Initial Values

As an improvement to this form, let’s add an initial value for the subject field: "I love your site!" (A little power of suggestion can’t hurt.) To do this, we can use the initial argument when we create a Form instance:

> ```python
> def contact(request):
>     if request.method == 'POST':
>         form = ContactForm(request.POST)
>         if form.is_valid():
>             cd = form.cleaned_data
>             send_mail(
>             cd['subject'],
>             cd['message'],
>             cd.get('email', 'noreply@example.com'),
>             ['siteowner@example.com'],
>             )
>             return HttpResponseRedirect('/contact/thanks/')
>     else:
>         form = ContactForm()
>             initial={'subject':'I love your site!'}
>     return render(request, 'books/contact_form.html', {'form': form})
> ```

Now, the subject field will be displayed prepopulated with that kind statement. Note that there is a difference between passing initial data and passing data that binds the form. The biggest difference is that if you’re just passing initial data, then the form will be unbound, which means it won’t have any error messages.

## 10.Custom Validation Rules

Imagine we’ve launched our feedback form, and the e-mails have started tumbling in. There’s just one problem: some of the submitted messages are just one or two words, which isn’t long enough for us to make sense of. We decide to adopt a new validation policy: four words or more, please.

There are a number of ways to hook custom validation into a Django form. If our rule is something we will reuse again and again, we can create a custom field type. Most custom validations are one-off affairs, though, and can be tied directly to the Form class. We want additional validation on the message field, so we add a clean_message() method to our Form class:

> ```python
> from django import forms
>
> class ContactForm(forms.Form):
>     subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
>     email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
>     message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
>
>     def clean_message(self):
>         message = self.cleaned_data['message']
>         num_words = len(message.split())
>         if num_words < 4:
>             raise forms.ValidationError('Not Enough words!')
>         return message
> ```

Django’s form system automatically looks for any method whose name starts with clean_ and ends with the name of a field. If any such method exists, it’s called during validation. Specifically, the clean_message() method will be called after the default validation logic for a given field (in this case, the validation logic for a required CharField).

Because the field data has already been partially processed, we pull it out of self.cleaned_data. Also, we don’t have to worry about checking that the value exists and is non-empty; that’s done by the default validator. We naively use a combination of len() and split() to count the number of words. If the user has entered too few words, we raise a forms.ValidationError.

The string attached to this exception will be displayed to the user as an item in the error list. It’s important that we explicitly return the cleaned value for the field at the end of the method. This allows us to modify the value (or convert it to a different Python type) within our custom validation method. If we forget the return statement, then None will be returned, and the original value will be lost.

## 11.Specifying labels

By default, the labels on Django’s auto-generated form HTML are created by replacing underscores with spaces and capitalizing the first letter - so the label for the email field is "Email". (Sound familiar? It’s the same simple algorithm that Django’s models use to calculate default verbose_name values for fields. We covered this in Chapter 4.) But, as with Django’s models, we can customize the label for a given field. Just use label, like so:

> ```python
> from django import forms
>
> class ContactForm(forms.Form):
>     subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
>     email = forms.EmailField(required=False,label='Your email address')
>     message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
>
>     def clean_message(self):
>         message = self.cleaned_data['message']
>         num_words = len(message.split())
>         if num_words < 4:
>             raise forms.ValidationError('Not Enough words!')
>         return message
> ```

## 12.Customizing Form Design

Our contact_form.html template uses {{ form.as_table }} to display the form, but we can display the form in other ways to get more granular control over display. The quickest way to customize forms’ presentation is with CSS. Error lists, in particular, could do with some visual enhancement, and the auto- generated error lists use <ul class="errorlist"> precisely so that you can target them with CSS. The following CSS really makes our errors stand out:



## 13.What’s Next?

This chapter concludes the introductory material in this book - the so-called “core curriculum.” The next section of the book, Chapters 7 to 13, goes into more detail about advanced Django usage, including how to deploy a Django application (Chapter 13). After these first seven chapters, you should know enough to start writing your own Django projects. The rest of the material in this book will help fill in the missing pieces as you need them. We’ll start in Chapter 7, by doubling back and taking a closer look at views and URLconfs (introduced first in Chapter 2).
